'Cantonese Dictionary' is used to create a dictionary list in English and
Chinese.  This program works by using a user's pre-defined word list, then
looking up the definitions online.  The definitions are then written to a csv
file --where column 1 = Cantonese Romanization (Yale); column 2 = English
definition; column 3 = Hanzi.
